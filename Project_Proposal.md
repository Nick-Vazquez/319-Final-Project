# Group 20 Project Proposal

---

### Need statement
People interested in aeronautics are often exposed to models and simulations when learning about space-grade technologies, but aren't often able to see real-world applications of this.

### Purpose
This app is meant to provide users with sighting information for any North American Aerospace Defense Command _(NORAD)_ registered satelite. These sightings should be limited to those that are visible to the naked eye or with a telescope.

Users will enter a location and select which satelites to track within the application. A map of satelite locations display, and the user can select from a list of "visual pass times". Selecting a pass time from the list will display the passing satelite and the azimuth/altitude of the pass.

### Planning
1. Use cases
2. User description
3. Use case modelling
4. Wireframing
5. Component separation
6. Dependency integration
7. Application test definitions
8. Application integration
